ABSTRACT = {High myopia is a significant public health issue globally and in the United States (US), where it affects ~4% of the population or 13 million people. This is a potentially blinding condition, but complications can be prevented with early intervention in childhood. Several countries have developed robust data on high myopia, but the United States' data on high myopia remains lacking. Further, underrepresented populations are at particular risk of complications due to reduced access to optometric and ophthalmic care. We performed a systematic scoping review of population-based studies that investigated the prevalence of high myopia across racial and ethnic groups in the US to identify the impact of high myopia on underrepresented communities. Only four studies were identified that met inclusion criteria, which highlights the need to further investigate the topic in the United States. The prevalence of high myopia ranged from a low of 1.8% among Hispanic populations to a high of 11.8% among Chinese populations. Our study demonstrated a paucity of high myopia data in the United States and variable rates of high myopia depending on the time and location of each study. More complete prevalence data will help identify opportunities for community-based interventions to prevent debilitating and blinding complications of high myopia.},

      abstract = {Measuring progress in meeting the need for family planning  requires not only an assessment of overall levels and  trends  in contraceptive prevalence and the unmet need for  family planning, but also an assessment of the range and  types of  contraceptive methods used. This data booklet  presents estimates of the prevalence of  ontraceptive use  by method based on the World Contraceptive Use 2019 (based  on data from 1,247 surveys for 195 countries or areas of  the world) and additional tabulations obtained from  microdata and survey reports. The estimates are presented  for female and male sterilisation, intrauterine device  (IUD), implant, injectable, pill, male condom, withdrawal,  rhythm and other methods combined. The estimates of  contraceptive prevalence (any, modern or traditional) for  1994 and 2019 are from Estimates and Projections of Family  Planning Indicators 2019.},

 abstract = {The level of unmet need for contraception—an important motivator of international family planning programs and policies—has declined only slightly in recent decades. This study draws upon data from 51 surveys conducted between 2006 and 2013 in Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean to provide an updated review of the reasons why many married women having unmet need are not practicing contraception. We examine the reasons for contraceptive nonuse and how these reasons vary across countries and according to national levels of unmet need and contraceptive use. We present specific findings regarding the most widespread reasons for nonuse, particularly infrequent sex and concerns regarding side effects or health risks. Our findings suggest that access to services that provide a range of methods from which to choose, and information and counseling to help women select and effectively use an appropriate method, can be critical in helping women having unmet need overcome obstacles to contraceptive use.},

abstract = {The goal of supervised learning is to build a concise model of the distribution of class labels in terms of predictor features. The resulting classifier is then used to assign class labels to the testing instances where the values of the predictor features are known, but the value of the class label is unknown. This paper describes various supervised machine learning classification techniques. Of course, a single chapter cannot be a complete review of all supervised machine learning classification algorithms (also known induction classification algorithms), yet we hope that the references cited will cover the major theoretical issues, guiding the researcher in interesting research directions and suggesting possible bias combinations that have yet to be explored.},
