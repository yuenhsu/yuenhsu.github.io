I cannot recall the reason I chose this one, but it happened to work. To see other key type accepted, see Improving Git protocol security on GitHub.\n-b 521 (yellow underline) specifies the bits to be 521\n-C \"EMAIL\" (green underline) specifies a comment to add to your public key, enclosed in double quotes. This is helpful when identifying which public keys you have authorized in a remote system, so it is common practice to add your email address as the comment.\n-f ~/.ssh/KEYFILE (blue underline) is the name for the keys. With the -f flag, there is no need to specify the public key name as it will always be the same name as the private key, but with .pub as the suffix.\n\nSee ssh-keygen man page for more options, but the ones listed above were all I needed.\n\n\n\nTerminal ssh-keygen output\n\n\nAfter running this command, the system will prompt you to enter a passphrase, but I usually just hit Enter to not set a passphrase (purple box). Finally, terminal shows output (olive? box), including path to private key and public key, fingerprint, and randomart image.\n\n\nUsing UI\nIf accessing terminal is not possible, you can still generate keys through UI. However, this approach provides fewer key type/size and requires key password. Follow the steps in How to connect via SSH using keys."
